# Hr_Analytics_Dashboard
Interactive HR Analytics Dashboard built using Power BI, Power Query (ETL), and DAX to analyze employee attrition, demographics, and compensation trends.

# 🔎 Project Overview

This project presents an interactive HR Analytics Dashboard developed using Power BI, leveraging Power Query for ETL and DAX for analytical modeling.

The dashboard provides data-driven insights into employee attrition, workforce demographics, compensation distribution, and job roles to support strategic HR decision-making.

The objective was to transform raw HR data into a structured analytical model and deliver actionable business insights through interactive visualizations.
# 🎯 Business Problem

Employee attrition impacts productivity, cost, and workforce stability. HR teams require clear visibility into:

Which employee segments are at higher risk of attrition
